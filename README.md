**BUGS LIST**
1. Lines are not drawn properly. They are mirrored. 
That means if the rectangle is on the middle, lines are drawn on the middle.
If its to the left, lines are drawn on the right, and vice versa.
Applies to the up/down drawing too.

2. Rectangle detection - no idea how to implement intersection checking algortithm.
